What's wrong with you?
Are you stupid?
Yes, yes, sure, whatever. Stop bothering me. Don't you have better things to-...never mind.
No, and don't let that unqualified failure distract you from the fact that the Atlanta Falcons blew a 25 point lead in the Super Bowl.
Well, I'm sure there will be an attempt. Which is more than I can say for the things in *your* life.
Yes. After putting forth your best effort, you will finally accomplish that! And then you'll wake up and be you again. Oh well.
No, but you'll come close. Here, have a medal. :third_place: Third out of three. You're in the 33rd percentile! Really moving up in the world, comparatively speaking.
Look at this: :milk: Is it half full or half empty? Well, if only mental attitude could help you actually accomplish things. Then you might have ended up somewhere better than asking a robot questions.
Is a :tomato: a fruit or vegetable?
:thinking: :thinking: :thinking:
Only if traps are gay. So, yes.
:see_no_evil: I don't want to answer. I encourage you to do it. It'll be funnier that way. For everyone except you. But it's for the best, really; what else are you good for? :see_no_evil:
The chances of that happening are only slightly higher than you getting your life together.
You know that Katy Perry song "Firework"? Where she says "Come on show 'em what you're worth / Make 'em go 'oh, oh, oh' / As you shoot across the sky"? Well, good news! She was actually talking about you. Specifically, the spectacular disaster that's your life crashing and burning while everyone else watches in awe wondering how one person could fuck up *so* badly.
Once upon a time, there was a young, fearless, starry-eyed individual who had grand hopes and dreams. Now that individual is asking a robot questions.
I fail to see how asking a robot this is going to make your mother love you again, but I guess you know her better than I do.
